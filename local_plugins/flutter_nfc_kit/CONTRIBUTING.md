# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `flutter_nfc_kit`!

## GitHub Workflow

We have two main branches:

* `develop` branch (default) is for actively development and RC releases.
* `master` branch is for stable releases.

Both branches are protected. Pull requests are needed for any changes.

Please always make your changes on `develop` branch, and submit your PR against it.
If there are any merge conflicts, please resolve them by rebasing your commits.
